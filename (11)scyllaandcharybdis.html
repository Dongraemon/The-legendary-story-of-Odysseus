                    Following Tyresius's advice, Odysseus was once a woman and, on the other hand, chose the closest side to the six-headed monster, Scylla, a violent vortex of Charybdis. Tyresius advised Odysseus to pass six men to Silas at the expense of no more men.
        
        As they approached the mouth of the strait between Scylla and Charybdis, the warriors bowed in fear of violent death on both sides. Only Odysseus is quiet and sad. I had to lose six brave warriors, but I was ready to do so to save others. When they passed Scylla, she picked up six men and allowed the rest to pass safely. Odysseus never forgot the screams of those who had to sacrifice and mourned betrayal until the last days. He did not tell a warrior a motive. Then his ship was overtaken by Charibdys but survived.
