                    Odysseus and his legion departed from Troy aboard 12 ships. The tranquil water promoted the movement of the ship and went well into the sea. A few days later, they found the land and Eurylochus, which became the commander of Odysseus, anchored, went to the beach and devastated the city.
        
        Ciconians and locals fled to nearby mountains to see the ship's weight moored and see warriors entering the beach ever since. Odysseus and his men plundered and plundered the empty city. But the Odysseus people immediately resisted the effort to board the ship and fell asleep on the shore after a hearty meal with wine flying like water.
        
        Before the first light came out, the Ciconians returned with their fierce neighbours and erected warriors. Odysseus and his men hurriedly retreated to the ship but had already suffered great damage. After listening to the words of Eurylochus, Odysseus and Eurylochus fought each other but broke up with their colleagues and peace was reestablished among the warriors.
