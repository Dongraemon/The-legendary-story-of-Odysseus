                    The land of Phaeacians, believed by historians to be the modern Corfu, was where Odysseus found himself after a terrible storm. The local princess, Naf Sica, led Odysseus to the father's palace, naked, off the coast. In the court of King and Queen, he heard the song of the Trojan War by the Democrats.
        
        Odysseus was overcome with sorrow when he heard stories of war and his invention, the Trojan horse. At that time, my emotions broke down, and tears broke out. People gathered around him and asked who he was and why the story affected him. Then Odysseus revealed his true identity and struggled to reach Ithaca.
        
        Phaeacians give their fastest and best boats after their ordeal, and good luck on their way home. So the protagonist finally came back to Ithaca and wanted to see his wife Penelope and his son Telemacos.
