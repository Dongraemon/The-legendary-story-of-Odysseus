            <h3>Brave man who had intelligence, leadership, and courage</h3>
            <p>Roman name: Ulysses</p>
            <p>Odysseus was the king of Ithaca, son of Laertes and Antikleia and leader of the Kephallenians. He married to Penelope and he also got a son Telemachos. The protagonist was also lucky enough to receive exclusive help and protection from the goddess Athena regularly. Hesiod describes Odysseus as "patient-centric," and Homer describes him as "sacred" like "God's Resource" and a genuinely persuasive word that "flooded like snowflakes in winter." However, the protagonist was not only a thinker but a warrior and his courage and fighting power are mentioned in Homer's vocation "The City Pillager". Homer also says that the name Odysseus means "the victim of the enemy," which refers to the displeasure that Poseidon has directed against the hero.</p>

            <p>Odyssey is probably a popular story spoken orally to the same generation as Homer wrote the story in one story. The story is told by Homer in a flashback format and tells the legendary journey of King Odysseus back to the old palace and family after the Trojan War.</p>
