                Tried and tired, Odysseus ordered the ship to anchor on the island of Trina. This island was sacred to the sun god Helios. Although Odysseus was warned by Tyresius and Circe not to harm the cows, his men ignored him and set out to slaughter and feast.

                Immediately Helios complained to Zeus and vowed to take revenge by sending the sun to Hades, but it never happened again. Odysseus sank Zeus in a ship with Thunderbolt. The flooding Odysseus somehow swept Scylla and Charybdis and washed off to the beach from an unknown island.
