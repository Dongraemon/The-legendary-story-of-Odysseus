                    In the darkness of the night, a remote island arose. This was Telepylos, an island with cliff-shaped natural defences and catwalks. Each ship went through a calm harbour surrounded by cliffs, except Odysseus.
        
        Two warriors went to the beach to explore the island, and they met a girl and took him to her father. Near the castle, they saw a huge woman calling her husband. A giant, her husband, approached and grabbed one of them and captured him. The other risked his life, and the entire tribe of the giants who lived on the ground chased him. At the port, Odysseus' men tried to escape, but the giants smashed the ship with huge rocks and breathed alive. Since only Odysseus anchored off the island, he was able to escape the ship with the crew.
