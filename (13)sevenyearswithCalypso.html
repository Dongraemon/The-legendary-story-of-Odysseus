                    The island on which Odysseus found himself was Ogygia, where he saw him unconscious on the beach for seven years with the Calypso fairy. She promised immortality in exchange for her love, but soon Odysseus once again felt the desire to see Ithaca and his family, an unhappy wife, and a son who would have grown up until then.
        
        Even though Calypso was a beautiful and powerful goddess-like, she couldn't fill the unfinished feeling that Odysseus always had in his mind. However, Calypso fell in love with him and did not let him go. On behalf of Zeus, Hermes appeared in front of Calypso and told him to send Odysseus. One day, finally on his own raft, Odysseus departed for Ithaca as a wooden float, but once again was trapped in another strange land in the middle of the storm and the coast.
