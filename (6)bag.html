                    Odysseus, who fled from Cycling Land, found a ship near Aeolia, home to Aeolus, the god of wind. Aeolus blew the sea and land. Upon hearing the trip to Odysseus' house, Aeolus gave him a wind-filled bag to safely blow the wind. Odysseus once again sailed the sea, kept his bag all day, and spent a night without sleep, overwhelmed with fatigue and fell asleep.
        
        Curiosity overcame athe two men carrying bags and waiting for the opportunity to see the leader defending his life. They had a moment when Odysseus fell asleep while approaching the Ithaca coast. Without hesitation for a moment, the two sailors opened the bag. The wind in the bag came out, causing a violent storm that drove the ship back. Detecting something wrong with the movement of the Odysseus ship was only starting to return to Aeolia. This time Aeolus never gave up on the gift of the wind again, and the heartbreaking Odysseus once again set off on a hard trip back to Ithaca.
