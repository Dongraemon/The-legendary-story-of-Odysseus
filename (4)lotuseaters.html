                    Rounding south, Odysseus and his men headed to the lotus pond land. While Odysseus scouted around the ground, some of his men mingled with the original inhabitants and ate local lotus flowers that grew on the ground. Soon everything was blurry, and people were heavily influenced by toxins that make them fall asleep.
        
        The lotus flower they ate was naturally a drug and made me forget everything about my family and home. These people wanted to stay on this land and eat lotus flowers for the rest of their lives. They refused to go home. Desperately, Odysseus and the other men had to take them back by boat. Without delay, they started sailing, and when they woke up, these people had to jump into the sea, swim to the shore and tie it to the mast to eat lotus.
