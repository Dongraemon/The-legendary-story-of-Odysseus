                    Odysseus, who barely saved his life, and one of the remaining ships landed on Aeaea Island, home to the mighty Circe, the juggler, and the mighty wizard. Circe, unknown to the warriors with the help of powerful magic, has already imagined arriving on her island. Some of Odysseus's colleagues, sent to explore the island, walked into Circe's palace and saw him sit on her magnificent throne, surrounded by wild animals that were once male. A beautiful juggler turned mighty warriors into pigs by pressing her staff once.
        
        Odysseus drank a particular herbal medicine that protects him from Circe's magic with the help of Hermes. When she looked at him, the wizard knew that her spell was ineffective and demanded that his man returns to human form upon his request. Odysseus agreed, and he and his men lived on the island all year round. Later that year, Odysseus decided to leave Aeaea and go on his way home. Circe, who can predict the future, gave directions on what to do afterwards. She went to the underground world and met the blind prophet Tyre Sius and asked him for guidance.
