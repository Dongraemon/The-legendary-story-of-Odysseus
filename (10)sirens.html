            Odysseus sailed for days without looking at the ground. Soon, however, a strange, strange sound touched the ears of those on board. I liked the sound and wanted to cry with joy. Odysseus immediately realized that Circe was approaching the Siren that warned him.

The wizard instructed him to wax everyone's ears to listen to the siren song. Odysseus did precisely the same as his men but wanted to hear his strange song. So he ordered his crew to tie him to the mast, so he could not jump into the sea to meet the Siren.

Those who were blocked by wax with their ears did not hear anything, and the ship passed near the Siren. Suddenly, Odysseus wanted to swim towards the Siren because he was free from his ties, and their songs just became bright and very beautiful and attractive. However, the rope was very tight, and fortunately, I could not lose myself. His colleagues could not hear the screams of the Siren and their leaders. Siren's song faded as the ship moved away from the shore.
