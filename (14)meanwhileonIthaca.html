                    Telemachus, son of Odysseus, who was just 20 years old, decided to find his old father. His mother was angry at herself. Ten years passed after the Trojan War, and her husband never returned, so she always suffered from suitors. Every day, she managed to thwart their development with original tricks. She told suitors that she was weaving a burial cover for Odysseus' father, and she would think she would marry her only when it was finished.
        
        Penelope's trick was to knit the fabric during the day and release it at night. So suitors waited indefinitely for their husband to return. But the commerce man betrayed her to suitors and soon returned and demanded her hand and the Ithaca kingdom.
        
        Telemachus knew that his mother had successfully distanced 108 suitors and decided to start his quest. He went to Sparta with the goddess Athena and some faithful warriors and met Menelaus and asked if his father had any news. Unfortunately, Menelaus knew nothing, and Telemachus was disappointed to return to Ithaca.
