                    After sailing for weeks without any more adventure, the warriors found a strange land. Odysseus and a handful of men visited the beach to find the land.
        
        A few minutes walk from the boat brought it to the mouth of a huge cave. Curious warriors entered the cave and found it a habitation for a huge being. Further, they found a flock of sheep in the cave, were hungry, slaughtered a few animals and ate flesh. Unknown to them, this was the hideout of Cyclops' Polyphemus, and this land was home to the giant Cyclopes.
        
        Returning to the cave, Polyphemus closed the entrance with a huge rock as usual. Odysseus and his men ran toward the entrance, but they were embarrassed by their greetings. Here was a huge rock that prevented the escape from being bigger than the rock. Polyphemus turned to the warriors and asked about them. Odysseus told Poly Pemus that he was a sailor who got lost and went to the beach to find food without revealing their identity.
        
        Polyphemus, unfortunately for his sheep to be killed and eaten by these people, refused to leave the cave. Every day, he ate two brave warriors, shooting his brain at the cave wall and chewing it raw. Because she could not stand this cruel act, Odysseus planned to expel them. He had a strong wine gourd with him, and one day he gave it to Polyphemus, and he took it to Polyphemus and greeted his neck. Wine made Cyclops sleepy and fell asleep in a few minutes. Odysseus and his remnants took red poker from the fireplace and pushed it into Cyclop's only eye.
        
        The sleeping giant shocked, howling in pain and anger. He asked to know who did this. But again, the presence of Odysseus' heart proved its essence and exclaimed his name, "Nobody." Polyphemus now trips over his feet and runs to his hideout to see what happened to his fellow Cyclops. When they asked Polyphemus what happened, Cyclops said no one had stopped him. Another Cyclos laughed out loud, called him a fool, and said, "nobody" could harm him.
        
        The next morning, Odysseus and his men tied themselves to the sheep's stomach, and in this way, escaped when Pollymus had her flock grazing in his lair. When outside, the warriors ran for the safety of the ship. However, Odysseus was proud of his brilliance and could not resist mocking Polyphemus. The moment they sailed, he cried to Cyclops, Odysseus, who blinded himself. Polyphemus, unable to see in anger, threw a huge rock in the direction of his voice. Luckily, Odysseus lacked a target, and his ship would have been smashed. Polyphemus exclaimed to his father, the sea god Poseidon, to avenge this injustice, after which Odysseus became the oath of Poseidon.
