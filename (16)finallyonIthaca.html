                    The arrival of Odysseus to Ithaca was inconspicuous and approached the palace in the form of a beggar. He met his old servants and his son Telemachus. From them, he has long learned about suitors who are bothering Penelope. Odysseus still met a wife who did not recognize him in the form of a beggar.
        
        He talked about his husband's courage and how he helped him win the Trojan War. This tail shed tears. Calming herself, she always approached suitors who were hanging around the palace and set up simple missions for them. Penelope will marry someone who can tie Odysseus' bow and shoot an arrow through the twelve axe handles.
        
        The suitors pushed and pushed each other for success. However, they hardly knew that what they faced was impossible. Tying a bow belonging to Odysseus was not an easy task, but it required skill, not robbery. One by one, each suitor tried his luck, but to no avail. Finally, Odysseus picked up the bow and tied the bow in one fluid motion, flying an arrow piercing all 12 axe handles. After that, there was chaos.
        
        Odysseus revealed his true identity and began to massacre suitors, and soon with the help of Telemachus and the Swedish mouse, emptied the courts of all 108 of them. The suitor died, and all the maids who became slaves to the suitor hung. When Penelope heard the massacre, she rushed to court. Due to the sudden events, she set up another test for him not to believe that this strange beggar was her lost husband, Odysseus.
        
        In front of Opel Seuss, Penelope ordered the palace bells to remove the bed from the bedroom alone outside. Upon hearing this, Odysseus took an energetic attitude with anger, and this bed was made of living oak with his own hands, and no one could save the world. The joyful Penelope ran to Odysseus and hugged him in tears because she reassured that this man's beloved husband returned to her. Only Odysseus knew the secrets of the bed, and his words were proof that she needed to believe in him.
