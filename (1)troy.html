                    <p>Troy's Paris began the day he kidnapped Helen, the wife of Menelaus, king of Sparta. The furious Menelaus has pledged to all of the Greek kings, including Odysseus, to keep Helen's honour when someone tries to insult her. However, Odysseus tried to avoid the promise to Menelaus by avoiding bluffing. Menelaus' brother Agamemnon, as Odysseus lied, the legendary warrior set out as Troy, and Achilles, armed with Agamemnon, he called Nestor, Wise Nestor, and Tesser, the Master Archer.

            Ten years have passed since the Greeks attacked Troy, and they were still there outside the stable walls, and fighting the locals proved to be a brave warrior. In the decade of the war, the sly Odysseus, the most trusted adviser and counsellor of the Greek leader King Agamemnon, planned to deceive the Trojan. He wanted to make the Greeks believe that they had lost their nerves and then returned to Greece.
            
            In the night, Greeks abandoned Troy and left only a giant wooden horse on the wheel outside the city's door. When the dawn fell, the Trojans were surprised to see that there were only horses, not Greek troops. They truly believed that the Greeks left this horse as a gift to the gods and had a good sea trip. So they drove wooden horses into the city and began revelation to celebrate the end of the war.
            
            However, unknown to the Trojan, Odysseus drilled a hole in a wooden horse to hide several Greek warriors. This plan was the only way to enter a city that had been in defence for many years. Now they were in Odysseus, and his men went out of the dummy and slaughtered unsuspecting guards. Then they opened the gates and forced the entire Greek army, hiding a few miles away, to enter the city. Therefore, thanks to Odysseus' plans, the Greeks won the Trojan War. At the end of the war, Odysseus and his men sailed to Ithaca, their hometown, but eventually, only one of them would return.
