                    A living person has never entered the underground world. However, the brave Odysseus decided to do so to continue the journey and finally get to Ithaca! Odysseus and his men sacrificed to the god Hades at the foot of the Acheron River, and Odysseus alone headed for a dark underground world. Tyresius appeared to Odysseus, and the blind prophet told him that to go home, he had to pass between two big monsters, Scylla and Charybdis.
