                    But this was not the end of Odysseus' journey. The prophet Tyre Sius warned in advance that after he reaffirmed himself as the king of Ithaca, he had to take the ship's oars and travel inland. Indeed, several years later, Odysseus chose King Italia's Telemacos to leave his wife Penelope and travel inland.
        
        He paddled for days and didn't know what it was, but people admitted wherever he went. One day, Odysseus, across the central Ithaca coast, met people who had never seen the sea and therefore did not know what the oars were. There, Odysseus took a lifelong journey and took a local princess for the bride. For years, he lived among these people and was able to breathe last, far from the sea, family and beloved Ithaca.
